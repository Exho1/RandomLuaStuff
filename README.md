# RandomLuaStuff

This repo contains a variety of scripts (functional and non) that I've written since I learned Lua. Some of them are ideas I've had that failed and others are old versions of addons I've released. Regardless hopefully somebody will find these as useful as I have, I've copied snippets of code from them for ages.
